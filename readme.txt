In an intuitive click-and-drag interface, you can add and edit styled Bootstrap elements right inline with your content. No fussing with shortcodes.

== Description ==

We use Bootstrap. We use WordPress. Many of our themes, and many themes available, are based on Bootstrap. Why not create a neat and intuitive way to add Bootstrap elements right inline with your WordPress page and post content? Yeah, that was our thinking when we designed this plugin. We also don't like shortcodes. The page can get messy and it's hard to distinguish the shortcode text and your content at first glance. Your eyes have too much to parse.

That's where our plugin comes in. In an intuitive click-and-drag interface, you can add and edit styled Bootstrap elements right inline with your content. No fussing with shortcodes.

= Bootstrap Elements Supported =

We haven't gotten around to adding every Bootstrap element available yet. We have a bunch for you though! The ones you'd probably need most anyway. Let's dig in. Here's your list of supported elements.

* Accordion
* Alert / Error
* Button
* Collapsing Section
* Code
* Horizontal Rule
* Image
* Rows / Columns
* Spacer
* Tabs
* Text Block
* Well

Okay, okay. Some of these aren't native Bootstrap elements, like the "image" and "text block." But here's the thing, when you add a row with columns, you'll want to add elements into those columns. This plugin allows you to add some native WordPress elements into your columns. Boom. Regard me.

= Adding a Bootstrap Element =

When adding an element, each element has its own settings. We're sure you already figured that. No worries. Just setting the stage.

* Navigate to a page or post you'd like to edit.
* Notice the "Add Bootstrap" button above the editor. It even has the Bootstrap logo to make it more obvious.
* Click it! A lightbox will appear with all the delicious shortcodes.
* Now you can choose which element you'd like to add.

 = Adding an Accordion =

* First, enter into the "Number of Tabs" field, the number of accordion items you'd like to add.
* Click the "Update" button.
* There should now be the "tab titles" and "tab content" wells for the number you specified.
* Fill out each of the titles and content wells.
* Scroll to the bottom or top of the lightbox and click "Add"

= Adding a Alert, Error, Warning, or Info =

* First choose the Bootstrap style for your message in the "Type of alert/error" dropdown.
* Then type your message into the "Message" field.
* Click "Add!"

= Adding a Button =

* First, choose a Bootstrap style for your button in the "Style of button" dropdown.
* Enter your button text in the "Button Text" field.
* Now choose where it links.
	* You can either select a page from the "Button URL (On-site)" dropdown.
	* Or you can copy and paste a URL into the "Button URL (Off-site)" field.
* Choose whether you'd like the button to open a new window with the "Open in a new window" checkbox.
* Click "Add!"

= Adding a Collapsing Section =

A collapsing section is essentially a Bootstrap styled button that expands or closes a content well.

* First, choose a Bootstrap style for your button in the "Style of button" dropdown.
* Fill out the button text in the "Button Text" field.
* Then fill out the content you'd like displayed in your content well in the "Tab Content" WYSIWYG editor.
* Click "Add!"

= Adding Code =

This is probable the easiest. Just fill out the textarea and click "Add." Boom

= Adding a Horizontal Rule =

* Select the type of rule by clicking on its graphic representation.
* Click "Add!"

= Adding an Image =

* Click the "Open Media Window" button.
* This opens the built-in WordPress media lightbox.
* Navigate to the image you'd like to add.
* Click on it to select it.
* Click the "Insert into Page" button.
* Click "Add!"

= Adding a Row / Columns =

* First, start by filling in how many columns you'd like in your row using the "Number of Columns" field.
* The visual representation should update for you automatically.
* If you'd like one column to be wider, click the plus button inside it.
* If you'd like one column to be smaller, click the minus button inside of it.
* To specify the standard Bootstrap responsive breakpoints, click the gear in the row you'd like to edit.
* A new form will appear with the following specifications:
	* col-lg-x
	* col-md-x
	* col-sm-x
	* col-xs-x
* Select each breakpoint size in each respective dropdown.
* Click done.

When you're done editing each column, don't forget to click "Add!"

= Adding a Spacer =

* All you have to do is set the height of the spacer in the "Height of Spacer" field. A numeric value will do. NO need to add "px."
* Click "Add!"

= Adding Tabs (tabbed content) =

* First, enter into the "Number of Tabs" field, the number of tabbed items you'd like to add.
* Click the "Update" button.
* There should now be the "tab titles" and "tab content" wells for the number you specified.
* Fill out each of the titles and content wells.
* Scroll to the bottom or top of the lightbox and click "Add!"

= Adding a Textblock =

These are necessary when you want to add text into a row's column.

* Simply fill out the WYSIWYG editor with the content of your choice.
* Click "Add!"

= Adding a Well =

A well is a Bootstrap styled block of text. It normally has a border and background color.

* Simply fill out the WYSIWYG editor with the content of your choice.
* Click "Add!"


= Editing a Bootstrap Element =

* To edit a Bootstrap element click the pencil icon in the upper-right-hand corner of the element.
* This will open the lightbox with your Bootstrap element's values filled out and ready to go.
* Edit them to your specifications.
* Click "Update!"

= Deleting a Bootstrap Element =

We can just hear your Bootstrap element screaming, "No! No! Don't delete me. You worked so hard to create me!" We can hear you cackling as you:

* Click the minus icon in the upper-right-hand corner of the Bootstrap element.
* You'll be present with an alert just in case you clicked the delete button by accident.
* If you wish to delete the element, click "OK."

= Moving a Bootstrap Element =

We want this to be easy for you. You may want to move your Bootstrap elements around. You can click and drag your element anywhere.

* Hover your mouse over the title of the element.
* You should see the move cursor appear.
* Click and drag the element to the new desired location.

NOTE: At this time you cannot drag the elements around inline text. If you wish to reorder elements with inline text, you'll need to cut and past the text where you want it.
